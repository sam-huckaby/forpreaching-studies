# Illustrations For Preaching
We've been doing small groups since the early church met in homes in the first century.

In the first century, small groups knew about the jobs, finances, struggles, and spiritual progress of their members.

In modern America, our small groups are lucky to know one or two of those categories about their members.

## How do we change things?
I wish I knew.

I know that what we have is difficult to use, hard to keep track of, and parts are often missed. We have been roughing together our solutions for too long. I don't know that one guy is going to be able to fox these problems, but someone has to start.
